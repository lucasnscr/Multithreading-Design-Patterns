### Barrier Pattern

![Barrier Pattern](https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/articles/xt9wfb3yopodcdixbcl1.png)

#### Explanation

The Barrier Object Pattern ensures synchronization of multiple threads at a predefined point, preventing any thread from proceeding until all have reached the barrier. This Spring Boot application demonstrates the pattern by simulating tasks executed by multiple threads, synchronizing at a barrier before proceeding. This approach is useful in scenarios requiring coordinated completion of parallel tasks, such as parallel computing, batch processing, and gaming.

The Barrier Object Pattern is used to synchronize multiple threads at a predefined point, ensuring that no thread proceeds until all threads have reached this barrier. This pattern is useful in scenarios where a set of tasks must be completed before any further steps can be taken.

#### Use Cases

1.	**Parallel Computing**: When dividing a large computational task into smaller sub-tasks, each sub-task must be completed before the results can be combined.
2.	**Batch Processing**: Ensuring all tasks in a batch are completed before moving to the next batch.
3.	**Gaming**: Synchronizing the state of multiple players before advancing to the next level or stage.

#### Real-Life Example

In a multiplayer online game, all players must complete their turns before the game can proceed to the next round. The Barrier Object Pattern can ensure that all players reach the synchronization point (end of their turn) before the game advances.

### Implementing Active Object Pattern in Spring Boot

We’ll create a simple Spring Boot application demonstrating the Barrier Object Pattern. The application will simulate multiple threads performing tasks, synchronizing at a barrier before proceeding.

#### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Setup Spring Boot Project**

   Create a new Spring Boot project using Spring Initializr or your preferred method. Include the following dependencies:
    - Spring Web
    - Spring Boot DevTools

2. **Define the Task Service**

   Create a service to simulate tasks being performed by multiple threads.

   ```java
   public interface TaskService {
       void performTask(int taskId) throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException;
   }
   ```

3. **Implement the Task Service with a Barrier**

   Create a class that implements the TaskService and uses a CyclicBarrier to synchronize threads.

   ```java
   @Service
   public class TaskServiceImpl implements TaskService {
       
       private final CyclicBarrier barrier;

       public TaskServiceImpl() {
           int numberOfThreads = 5; // Number of threads to synchronize
           this.barrier = new CyclicBarrier(numberOfThreads, () -> {
               System.out.println("All tasks completed. Proceeding to the next step...");
           });
       }

       @Override
       public void performTask(int taskId) throws InterruptedException, BrokenBarrierException {
           System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " is performing...");
           Thread.sleep((long) (Math.random() * 1000)); // Simulate task execution time
           System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " reached the barrier.");
           barrier.await(); // Synchronize at the barrier
       }
   }
   ```

4. **Create the Controller**

   Create a controller to initiate tasks and demonstrate the barrier synchronization.

   ```java
   @RestController
   @RequestMapping("/tasks")
   public class TaskController {

       @Autowired
       private TaskService taskService;

       @GetMapping("/execute")
       public ResponseEntity<String> executeTasks() {
           ExecutorService executorService = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);

           for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
               int taskId = i;
               executorService.submit(() -> {
                   try {
                       taskService.performTask(taskId);
                   } catch (InterruptedException | BrokenBarrierException e) {
                       e.printStackTrace();
                   }
               });
           }

           executorService.shutdown();
           return ResponseEntity.ok("Tasks started");
       }
   }
   ```

5. **Run the Application**

   Run the Spring Boot application and test the endpoint by invoking `/tasks/execute`.
